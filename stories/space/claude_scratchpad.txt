CAT GAME INTEGRATION - DEBUGGING SESSION
==========================================

CURRENT STATUS: Debugging win screen and Google Sheet issues

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
1. ❌ Win button still shows "REINTENTAR" instead of "FESTEJAR!"
2. ❌ catGameWon variable not resetting properly (shows true even after reset)
3. ❌ Google Sheet not being updated with Step 66 prompt
4. ❌ Game not triggering due to catGameWon: true

DEBUGGING ADDED:
✅ Enhanced initialization debugging
✅ Added localStorage state tracking
✅ Added catGameWon variable type checking
✅ Added comprehensive win screen debugging
✅ Added Google Sheet authentication checks
✅ Added aggressive reset functions (resetCatGameWinState, hardResetCatGame)

CURRENT STATE:
- Game shows: catGameWon: true (preventing trigger)
- User needs to: run hardResetCatGame() in console
- After reset, should see: catGameWon: false in debug logs

NEXT STEPS:
1. Get user to run hardResetCatGame() function
2. Verify catGameWon becomes false
3. Test cat game trigger
4. Test win screen button text
5. Test Google Sheet integration

SUSPECTED ISSUES:
- localStorage not clearing properly
- Button element not being found correctly
- Authentication issues for Google Sheet posting

FILES MODIFIED:
- script_wip.js (extensive debugging added)
- index_wip.html (button ID added)

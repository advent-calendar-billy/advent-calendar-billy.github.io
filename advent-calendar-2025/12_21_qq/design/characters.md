# Character Designs

## Design Philosophy
All characters are drawn in a notebook sketch style:
- Visible pencil construction lines
- Slightly wobbly outlines
- Exaggerated proportions (big heads, expressive hands)
- Simple but distinctive silhouettes
- Each character is recognizable by shape alone

## Character Silhouette Reference

All characters should be instantly recognizable by silhouette:

```
   CARL          PETRA         CHAD

   /^\           ~~~~          /--\
  (o o)         [□ □]         (@ @)
   \_/           ===           ===
    |           _/|\_         _/|\_
   /|\          / | \         / | \
   / \          |   |         |   |
```

## Idle Animations

## Hit Reactions

All characters have sketch-style hit reactions:
- Stars and spirals around head
- Wobbly motion lines
- "OOF!" "POW!" text bubbles
- Construction lines become visible (like facade cracking)

## Future Characters (TBD)
- Placeholder slots for more family/friends
- Each will have unique power theme
- Maintain consistent sketch aesthetic

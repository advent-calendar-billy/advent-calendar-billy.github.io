# Family Fighter - Design Overview

## Game Concept
A Street Fighter / Tekken style fighting game featuring friends and family members as playable characters.

## Aesthetic Direction
**Chosen Style: Hand-Drawn / Sketch**

Key visual characteristics:
- Paper/notebook texture backgrounds
- Wobbly, imperfect line work
- Pencil/pen sketch aesthetic
- Grid paper or lined paper elements
- Doodle-style UI elements
- "Finger Paint" and handwriting-style fonts
- Warm, aged paper tones (#f5f0e1)
- Black ink lines with occasional color accents

## Character Design Principles
- Characters look like they were sketched in someone's notebook
- Exaggerated, cartoony proportions
- Visible sketch lines and "mistakes" add charm
- Each character has a distinct silhouette
- Powers visualized with comic-style effects (POW!, ZAP!, etc.)

## Powers System
Each character has unique special moves themed around their personality:
1. **Bitcoin Power** - Crypto/blockchain themed attacks
2. **Maths Power** - Mathematical/equation based abilities
3. **Coaching Power** - Corporate motivation themed moves
